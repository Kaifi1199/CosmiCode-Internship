# CosmiCode Internship â€“ Week 2

This week focused on exploring the basics of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I implemented supervised learning techniques using scikit-learn, including:

- Linear Regression on the Iris dataset.
- A Decision Tree Classifier with visualization.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Used `train_test_split` to split data into training and testing sets and explained its importance.

All work is saved in `Week-2.ipynb` notebook.
