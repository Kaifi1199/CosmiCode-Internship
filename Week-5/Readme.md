# CosmiCode Internship â€“ Week 5

This week, I explored Deep Learning basics and built a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.  
- Learned about ANN, CNN, and RNN and their applications.  
- Built and trained a binary classification model using ANN.  
- Evaluated model accuracy and loss.  
- Experimented with different layer/neurons to improve performance.

All work is saved in `Week-5.ipynb` notebook.
