This project uses the **Mall Customers dataset** to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**

### âœ… Tasks Completed:
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** and visualized clusters with centroids.
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Applied **Hierarchical Clustering** and plotted a **Dendrogram**.
- Visualized clusters formed using **Agglomerative Clustering**.

Useful for understanding customer behavior and targeting segments more effectively.

All work is saved in `Week-3.ipynb` notebook.
