# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction App

This Streamlit web app predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease using a trained machine learning model. The app takes several medical features as input and provides a prediction along with visual insights.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Input patient data such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.
- 🤖 Get a prediction (Heart Disease / No Heart Disease) with probability.
- 📊 Visualize target distribution, correlation heatmap, and individual feature distributions.
- 📘 View detailed descriptions of all features.

## 📂 Files

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application code.
- `Week-6`: Implemented EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saved the best model for deployment.
- `heart_model.pkl`: Pre-trained ML model.
- `scaler.pkl`: Standard scaler used for preprocessing.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for visualization and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
