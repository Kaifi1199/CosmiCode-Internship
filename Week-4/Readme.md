## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluaation & HyperParameter Tuning - Week-4

This project compares a Logistic Regression model's performance before and after hyperparameter tuning.

âœ… Steps:
- Used Iris dataset
- Trained a default Logistic Regression model
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Compared Accuracy and AUC before vs after tuning

ðŸŽ¯ Result: Tuning improved performance to 100% Accuracy and AUC.

All work is saved in `Week-4.ipynb` notebook.
